  <h1>We Were All Rooting For You</h1>
  <h3>Tyra Banks</h3>
  <p><br><strong> I have never in my life yelled at a girl like this!</strong></br>
   <br> When my mother yells like this it's because she <b>loves me.</b>
   
   <br> <b> I was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you! How dare you!</b> </br>
   <br>Learn something from <i> this! </i> When you go to bed at night, you lay there and you take responsibility for <b> yourself </b> </br>
   <br>because nobody's going to take responsibility for you. </br>
   <br>You're rolling your eyes and you act like it's because you've heard it all before </br> 
   <br>you don't know where the hell I come from, You have no idea what I've been through, but I'm not a victim; I grow from it and I <i> learn. </i> </br>
   <br><strong>Take responsibility for yourself!</strong> </p> </br>
