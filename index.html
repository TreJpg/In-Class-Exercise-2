  <h1>We Were All Rooting For You</h1>
  <h3>Tyra Banks</h3>
  <p> <strong> I have never in my life yelled at a girl like this.</strong>
   <br> When my mother yells like this it's because she loves me.</br>
   <br>I was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you! How dare you! </br>
   <br>Learn something from this! When you go to bed at night, you lay there and you take responsibility for yourself </br>
   <br>because nobody's going to take responsibility for you. </br>
   <br>You're rolling your eyes and you act like it's because you've heard it all before </br> 
   <br>you don't know where the hell I come from, You have no idea what I've been through, but I'm not a victim; I grow from it and I learn. </br>
   <br>Take responsibility for yourself!</p> </br>
